# Pic Me 

## Description
PicMe is the place for photographers and clients to connect to build new relationships and strengthen exisiting ones. We like to think of our community as a place where you can share ideas, collaborate with others, or learn about the latest news regarding the industry. Photographers can use their accounts to post for potential clients to see, and for other photographers to look at. PicMe offers users full CRUD capabilites and allows users to manage their work. PicMe currently uses a system based on relevancy to display posts to the user.
